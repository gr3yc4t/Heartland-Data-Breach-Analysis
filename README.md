# Heartland-Data-Breach-Analysis

This is the final report of the analysis we have conducted as an homework of a Cybersecurity Master-Class at La Sapienza University of Rome.

We have analyzed the famous data breach suffered from Heartland in 2008, approaching the analysis as a Risk Assesment and trying to enumerate a list of NIST and CIS controls that could have helped the organization to mitigate the loss of money, information and repudiation.
